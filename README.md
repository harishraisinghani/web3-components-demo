# Web3 Components Demo

**Live demo:** https://covalenthq.github.io/Web3-Components-Demo

This is a working demo of the `<TokenBalances />` React component, which provides a complete and paginated balances table with all the ERC20 tokens and NFTs for a given wallet address and chainId.

![Token Balances RC Demo](./public/token-balances-rc-demo.gif)

The `<TokenBalances />` React component can be found in the Covalent [web3 components library](https://github.com/covalenthq/web3-resources/tree/main/components).

The Wallet Dashboard demonstrates how to use the `<TokenBalances />` component in either a web3 or web2 setting:

- **Web3 Wallet:** The wallet address and blockchain network `chainId` are taken from the connected wallet provider such as MetaMask to display the token balances. This is for integrating a wallet dashboard into a DApp. 
&nbsp;
- **Web2 Wallet:** The wallet address and blockchain network `chainId` are *manually* entered to display the token balances. This is for apps such as taxation tools.
